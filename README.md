<h1 align="center">Omelette Recipe</h1>
<p>I decided to make a responsive recipe page from SCRATCH using only HTML and CSS.
<br>
I got an idea from the Frontend Mentor website, and even though it's a simple project, I was happy to be able to do it myself in 2 hours!
<br>
Amazing website for Front-End beginners with several project ideas and challenges
<br>
from basic to advanced, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I highly recommend it!</p>
